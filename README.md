Soramimi Lyrics
===============

A [Soramimi Karaoke](http://soramimi.nl) lyrics parser. Lyrics go in, objects come out; can't explain that.


Install it:

```
gem install soramimi-lyrics
```

Grab your lyrics:

```
require 'soramimi-lyrics'

# Parse straight from a string:
song = SoramimiLyrics.parse(lyrics_string)

# Open up a file:
song = SoramimiLyrics.load('/path/to/soramimi/lyrics.txt')

# Or build it up:
song = SoramimiLyrics.new
song.add_line(%w{ Oh man! })
# ...

```

Now spit the contents back out in varying formats:

```
# Directly compatible with Soramimi Karaoke (ostensibly the original if imported from a file or string).

         { :syllable => "guy", :begin => 67520, :end => 68030 } ],
       [ { :syllable => "Oh ", :begin => 68500, :end => 68930 },
         { :syllable => "man!", :begin => 68930, :end => 69480 } ]
     ]
```


Notes
-----

English songs have a high rate of one-syllable-per-word lyrics. Japanese, on the other hand, is dense as hell:

* `Beat|ing up the wrong guy / Oh man!`: 6 one-syllable words, 1 two-syllable words.
* `Fu|ki|ton|de yu|ku fu|u|kei / ko|ru|ga|ru yo|u ni ma|e`: 2 four-syllable, 1 three-syllable, 3 two-syllable, 1 one-syllable "words".

(Soramimi Karaoke was originally made for displaying Japanese song lyrics in R≈çmaji, and so the `to_timecodes` return format is targeted at this.)
